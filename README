Description: This script 'prison' helps to create a chroot environment.
             It is primarly intended to build chroot environments
             for SSH/SCP/SFTP "jails" with OpenSSH on Linux.
             I use it with OpenSSH 4.9+ together with ChrootDirectory.
             It can be used together with rssh or scponly to further
             tighten the chroot environment.
             It is nothing new, but fullfills the job in the way I wanted.
